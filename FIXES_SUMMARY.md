# üîß Fixes Applied to Billing System

## üìã Summary of Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Data Synchronization Issues
**Problem**: Updates in My Account page were not reflecting in Billing Management page
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `lib/store.ts` with missing subscription update functions (`addSubscription`, `updateSubscription`, `removeSubscription`)
- Updated Billing Management page to use central store data instead of local storage
- Fixed customer dropdown lists to use real customer data from store
- Updated metrics to show real data from the store

### ‚úÖ 2. Button Functionality Errors in My Account Page
**Problem**: Support Tickets, Pause Plan, and Cancel Plan buttons were throwing errors
**Solution**:
- Fixed `updateCustomer` function calls to use the correct store method (`updateCustomerInStore`)
- Added missing email service methods (`sendAdminNotification`, `sendCancellationConfirmation`) to `lib/email-client.ts`
- Fixed subscription update calls in pause and cancel handlers
- Added proper error handling and toast notifications

### ‚úÖ 3. Change Plan Button Not Working
**Problem**: Change Plan button was navigating to wrong page and not working properly
**Solution**:
- Fixed navigation in `app/change-plan/page.tsx` to redirect to `/billing-management` instead of `/customer-billing/${customerId}`
- Ensured plan, price, and billing cycle parameters are properly passed
- Updated route handling to work with the existing billing management system

### ‚úÖ 4. Branding Inconsistency
**Problem**: Pages had inconsistent branding (StreamPlay vs GoBill AI)
**Solution**:
- **My Account Page** (`app/my-plan/page.tsx`): Uses "StreamPlay Billing Hub" branding ‚úÖ
- **Change Plan Page** (`app/change-plan/page.tsx`): Uses "StreamPlay" branding ‚úÖ
- **Billing Management Page** (`app/billing-management/page.tsx`): Uses "GoBill AI" branding ‚úÖ
- All other admin pages use "GoBill AI" branding as intended

### ‚úÖ 5. Store Enhancement
**Problem**: Missing subscription management functionality in central store
**Solution**:
- Added complete CRUD operations for subscriptions in the billing store
- Enhanced data persistence and synchronization
- Added real-time updates between components
